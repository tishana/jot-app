# Jot

 Jot is a frontend application I created using React for use with a backend called Note App API.
 
 You can see Jot in action [here](https://tishana.github.io/jot-app/). Please bear in mind that it may take a few moments to load the data from the API because it is deployed to Heroku and may be hibernating.

--------------------------------------------
## User Stories

* I can create a note (Create Note).
* I can view a list of notes (Read Note).
* I can edit a note (Update Note).
* I can view a note (Read Note).
* I can delete a note (Delete Note).

--------------------------------------------

## Technologies Used for Jot:

* React.js
* Axios
* Surge

--------------------------------------------
## How to Install Jot locally:

* Fork and clone this repository to your machine
* Change into the new directory
* Run npm install:

```
$ npm i

```
* Open another terminal tab, and run npm run start

```
$ npm run start

```

* A browser window will open, and you're all set.

You will see notes on the main page. You can delete these, and create your own. You can even connect it to your own back end by changing the urls.

## Challenges During this Project

My original goal for Jot was to make this a fullstack application. Since I would like to teach myself other frontend applications, I decided to keep the frontend and backend separate, using the backend as an API for any frontend.

I decided to use React because I wanted to know the framework well. It was part of the cirriculum at General Assembly and a requirement for Project 3. Since Project 3 was a group project the work was divided, and I focused more on the backend. This project was my opportunity to create a React application from start to finish. 

I decided to build a backend application with Node, Mongoose, and Express, which you can view [here](https://github.com/tishana/note-app).


--------------------------------------------
## Future Plans for Jot:

I want to add user authentication so anyone can log in and see their own notes. On top of that I would like to build out a way for people to share notes via SMS and send notes to other note apps like Evernote.
